vehicle_assignments ✅ Assignment tracking
routes             ✅ Route management
trip_history       ✅ Historical data
notifications      ✅ System notifications
ml_predictions     ✅ ML model results
... and 3+ more tables
```

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION METHODS**

### **1. Run the Test Script**
```bash
cd backend
python test_real_functionality.py
```
This script tests 20+ real functionalities and provides a success rate.

### **2. Start the Application**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

### **3. Test Real Features**
- Login with: HAL001/admin123 (Super Admin)
- Create transport requests
- View real-time dashboard statistics
- Test vehicle availability checking
- Use ML route optimization

## ❌ **WHAT'S NOT IMPLEMENTED (30%)**

### **Missing Admin Frontend**
- Admin dashboard UI (backend API exists)
- Vehicle management interface
- Driver management interface
- Analytics visualization charts

### **Advanced Features Not Built**
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
- Email notification system
- File upload functionality
- Mobile application

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employee_id": "HAL001", "password": "admin123"}'
# Returns real JWT token
```

### **Step 4: View API Documentation**
Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Interactive Swagger documentation
- Test all 25+ endpoints
- See real request/response schemas

### **Step 5: Use Frontend**
