## 🔧 Authentication Issue Resolution

The current system is authenticated as user "sahlswla" but needs to push to "Nibedita-Mohapatro" repository. Here are the solutions:

### Option 1: Manual Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Prepare the files**:
   ```bash
   # Create a zip file of the entire project
   cd "/home/sukeshi/smart vehicle tracker"
   zip -r hal_transport_system.zip . -x "*.git*" "*/node_modules/*" "*/venv/*" "*/logs/*"
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/Nibedita-Mohapatro/Hal_transport
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop the zip file or individual folders
   - Add commit message: "Initial commit: HAL Transport Management System"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using Personal Access Token

1. **Generate Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with "repo" permissions
   - Copy the token

2. **Configure git with token**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Nibedita-Mohapatro/Hal_transport.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install gh
   
   # macOS
   brew install gh
   ```

2. **Authenticate and push**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 4: SSH Key Method

1. **Generate SSH key** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "nibedita.mohapatro@hal.co.in"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub**:
   - Copy public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste the key

3. **Change remote URL and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Nibedita-Mohapatro/Hal_transport.git
   git push origin main
   ```
