# Role-Based Access Control Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Time Selection Enhancement ✅

**Frontend Changes:**
- **RequestForm.js**: Updated time input from manual text input to dropdown selection

- Improves user experience with clear time options

### 2. Role-Based Permission System ✅

**Backend Role Structure:**
- **super_admin** (HAL001): Full system access including approvals
- **transport_admin** (HAL002): Transport operations but NO approval rights

- ✅ **User Management** - Create, update, delete users
- ✅ **Vehicle Deletion** - Delete vehicles from system
- ✅ **Driver Deletion** - Delete drivers from system

#### Transport Admin + Super Admin:
- ✅ **Dashboard Access** - View admin dashboard and statistics
- ✅ **Request Management** - View, cancel, complete, and assign requests
- ✅ **Vehicle Management** - Create, update, toggle status (except delete)
- ✅ **Driver Management** - Create, update, toggle status (except delete)
- ✅ **Resource Assignment** - Assign vehicles and drivers to requests

#### Employee Only:
- ✅ **Request Creation** - Create new transport requests
- ✅ **Request Tracking** - View own request status and history

### 3. Frontend UI Updates ✅

**AdminDashboard.js:**
- ✅ **User Management Tab** - Hidden for transport_admin users
- ✅ **Role-based Navigation** - Only super_admin sees user management

**RequestDetailsModal.js:**
- ✅ **Approve/Reject Buttons** - Only visible to super_admin users
- ✅ **Assignment Features** - Available to both admin roles
- ✅ **Operational Actions** - Cancel/Complete available to transport_admin

### 4. Backend API Security ✅

**Updated Endpoints:**

#### Super Admin Only:
```python
# Request approval/rejection
PUT /api/v1/admin/requests/{id}/approve  # super_admin only
PUT /api/v1/admin/requests/{id}/reject   # super_admin only

# User management
GET /api/v1/admin/users/                 # super_admin only
POST /api/v1/admin/users/                # super_admin only
PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id}             # super_admin only
DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/{id}          # super_admin only

# Resource deletion
DELETE /api/v1/admin/vehicles/{id}       # super_admin only
DELETE /api/v1/admin/drivers/{id}        # super_admin only
```

#### Transport Admin + Super Admin:
```python
# Dashboard and requests
GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard              # transport_admin + super_admin
GET /api/v1/admin/requests               # transport_admin + super_admin

# Request operations
PUT /api/v1/admin/requests/{id}/cancel   # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/requests/{id}/complete # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/requests/{id}/assign   # transport_admin + super_admin

# Vehicle management
POST /api/v1/admin/vehicles/             # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/vehicles/{id}          # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/vehicles/{id}/toggle-status # transport_admin + super_admin

# Driver management
POST /api/v1/admin/drivers/              # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/drivers/{id}           # transport_admin + super_admin
PUT /api/v1/admin/drivers/{id}/toggle-status # transport_admin + super_admin
```

## Demo User Roles

### HAL001 - Super Admin
- **Username**: HAL001
- **Password**: admin123
- **Permissions**: Full system access
- **Can**: Approve/reject requests, manage users, full CRUD on all resources

### HAL002 - Transport Admin  
- **Username**: HAL002
- **Password**: transport123
- **Permissions**: Transport operations only
- **Can**: Manage vehicles/drivers, assign resources, complete requests
- **Cannot**: Approve/reject requests, manage users, delete resources

### HAL003 - Employee
- **Username**: HAL003
- **Password**: employee123
- **Permissions**: Request creation and tracking
- **Can**: Create requests, view own request history
- **Cannot**: Access admin features, manage resources

## Security Implementation

### 1. Backend Validation
- ✅ **Role Checking**: Every admin endpoint validates user role
- ✅ **Permission Enforcement**: Proper HTTP 403 responses for insufficient permissions
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Specific error messages for role violations

### 2. Frontend Protection
- ✅ **UI Hiding**: Buttons/tabs hidden based on user role
- ✅ **Role Detection**: Frontend reads user role from localStorage
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Clean interface without unauthorized options

### 3. API Security
- ✅ **JWT Validation**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions per endpoint
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with user information

## Business Logic

### Request Approval Workflow
1. **Employee** creates transport request
2. **Super Admin** reviews and approves/rejects request
3. **Transport Admin** assigns vehicle and driver to approved requests
4. **Transport Admin** marks requests as complete when finished

### Resource Management
- **Transport Admin** handles day-to-day vehicle and driver management
- **Super Admin** has oversight and can delete resources if needed
- **Employee** has no access to resource management

### User Administration
- **Super Admin** exclusively manages user accounts
- **Transport Admin** cannot create or modify user accounts
- **Employee** has no administrative access

## Testing Verification

### ✅ Tested Scenarios:
1. **Time Dropdown**: Verified dropdown shows proper time slots
2. **Super Admin Login**: Confirmed full access including approvals
3. **Transport Admin Login**: Verified limited access (no user management, no approvals)
4. **Employee Login**: Confirmed request creation with time dropdown
5. **Permission Enforcement**: Verified 403 errors for unauthorized actions
6. **UI Role-based Display**: Confirmed buttons/tabs hidden appropriately

### ✅ Security Validation:
- Role-based endpoint access working correctly
- Frontend UI adapts to user permissions
- Clear separation between operational and administrative functions
- Proper error handling for permission violations

## Summary

The system now has proper role-based access control with:
- **Clear separation** between approval authority (super_admin) and operations (transport_admin)
- **Enhanced time selection** with dropdown for better UX
- **Secure API endpoints** with granular permission checking
- **Intuitive frontend** that adapts to user roles
- **Complete audit trail** of all user actions

The transport management system is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security and role-based access control.
